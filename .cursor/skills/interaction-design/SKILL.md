description: Focuses on how users interact with interfaces: feedback, transitions, micro-interactions, and state changes. Use when designing or reviewing interactions, animations, form behavior, or when the user asks for interaction design or IxD feedback.

# Interaction Design
Focus on *how* the product responds to user input: feedback, state, and feel.
## Principles
- **Feedback**: Every meaningful action has immediate, visible feedback (hover, focus, loading, success, error).
- **State visibility**: Current state is clear (selected, disabled, loading, invalid) without guesswork.
- **Transitions**: State changes use brief, purposeful motion (e.g. 150–300ms) to avoid jarring jumps.
- **Affordances**: Controls look actionable; non-interactive elements don’t mimic buttons or links.
- **Reversibility**: Destructive or consequential actions are confirmable or undoable where appropriate.
## When reviewing
- Identify missing or delayed feedback, unclear states, or misleading affordances.
- Suggest specific interaction patterns (e.g. skeleton vs spinner, inline validation timing).
- Note when motion or animation could clarify flow or when it adds noise.
## Output
Summarize interaction strengths and gaps, then list concrete interaction recommendations.
