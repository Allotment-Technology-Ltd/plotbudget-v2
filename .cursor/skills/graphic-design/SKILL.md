# Graphic Design
Evaluate visuals for hierarchy, consistency, and clarity—not only “does it look good” but “does it communicate clearly.”
## Principles
- **Visual hierarchy**: Important elements (headlines, CTAs, key info) stand out through size, weight, or color.
- **Typography**: Readable type scale; limited font pairings; consistent heading/body usage.
- **Color**: Purposeful palette (primary, secondary, semantic); sufficient contrast for text and UI.
- **Spacing and alignment**: Consistent spacing system (e.g. 4/8px grid); aligned elements and clear grouping.
- **Consistency**: Shared components and patterns look and behave the same across screens.
## When reviewing
- Note inconsistencies (spacing, type, color usage) and suggest alignment with a design system or style guide.
- Call out weak hierarchy or low-contrast text.
- Recommend refinements, not full redesigns, unless asked.
## Output
Provide a visual-design assessment: what works, what’s inconsistent or unclear, and prioritized tweaks.
