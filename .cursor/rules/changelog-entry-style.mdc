# Changelog Entry Style

All changelog entries and release notes MUST use this exact style so they transfer to `apps/marketing/content/changelog.md` with minimal or no sanitization. See `docs/CHANGELOG-UX-GUIDE.md` for full UX principles.

## Structure

```markdown
## Section title

### Subsecton (optional)

- **Topic:** One sentence describing the change and its benefit to the user.
- Repeat for each user-facing change.
```

## Format rules

1. **Headings:** Use `##` for main sections, `###` for subsections. No links, no parenthesised dates or refs.

2. **Bullets:** One idea per bullet. Optional bold lead-in: `**Topic:** description` or plain `- Description`.

3. **Never include:** Ticket refs (PLOT-xxx), PR/issue refs (#58), commit hashes, conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix(scope):`), trailing `(2026-02-16)` or `(#65)`.

4. **Language:** Plain, user-focused. Describe what changed and why it matters. Avoid jargon, migrations, CI, E2E, or internal-only detail unless it directly affects the user.

5. **Omit internal-only changes:** CI, builds, migrations, tooling — unless user-visible.

## Example (correct style)

```markdown
## Release notes: Forecasting & budget adherence

### Summary
Forecasting for savings and repayments, simpler budget adherence, and dashboard updates.

### Forecasting
- **Savings forecast:** New pot forecast pages with target-date mode and projection mode. Date range pickers, area chart, lock-in amounts.
- **Repayment forecast:** New repayment forecast pages with payoff projections and suggested amount to hit target date.
- **Chart fixes:** Unique X-axis values and gradient IDs so charts render correctly.

### Budget adherence
- **New summary format:** Actual allocation and percentage, plus over/under target (e.g. "Needs £700 (25%). 3% over target of 22%").

### Dashboard
- **Savings progress cards** and **Repayment progress cards** for at-a-glance status.
- **Debt trend chart** for cumulative repayments. Savings-over-time chart removed.
```

## Sanitization

Content written this way avoids what `sanitizeChangelog.js` strips: commit links, refs, scope prefixes, conventional prefixes. Paste into `apps/marketing/content/changelog.md` or use as PR release notes with minimal edits.
