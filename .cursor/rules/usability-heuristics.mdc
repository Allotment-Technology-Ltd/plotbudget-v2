# NIELSEN'S 10 USABILITY HEURISTICS

Every feature must align with usability principles:

1. **Visibility of System Status** - Keep users informed in real-time. Immediate feedback on actions. Toast notifications for async operations. Show what changed.
2. **Match System and Real World** - Use user's language, not system jargon. Familiar metaphors. Real-world conventions.
3. **User Control and Freedom** - Provide undo/redo. Clear "emergency exits" from unwanted states. No locked-in workflows.
4. **Error Prevention** - Prevent problems before they occur. Confirm destructive actions. Disable invalid options.
5. **Error Messages** - Plain language, no error codes. Identify the problem. Suggest a constructive solution.
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall** - Make objects, actions, options visible. Don't force users to remember. Show context.
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency** - Shortcuts for experts. Customizable workflows. Progressive disclosure for novices.
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** - Remove irrelevant information. Focus on essentials. Reduce cognitive load.
9. **Help and Documentation** - Task-focused help. Searchable. Concrete steps, not abstract descriptions.
10. **Error Recovery** - Undo/Redo on destructive actions. Restore data when possible. Graceful degradation.

## Applied to Destructive Actions

- Confirmation dialog with task name + clear consequence statement
- Toast notification after action confirming what happened ("Task deleted" not just "Done")
- Undo button in toast (heuristic #3, #10)
- Disable for 500ms to prevent double-clicks (heuristic #4)
- Clear language: "Delete task" not "Remove" or "Purge" (heuristic #2)
