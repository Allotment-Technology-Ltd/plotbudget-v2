# PLOT Calm Design Rules

PLOT follows Calm Design (calmdesignlab.com). Design for **completion** and **intention**, not engagement and attention extraction. Every screen, notification, and interaction should help users finish a task and leave — not keep them in the app.

## NEVER

- Add infinite scroll, engagement streaks, or "time in app" maximising patterns
- Use countdown timers or false urgency language
- Design notifications that function as re-engagement spam
- Use red/warning colours for routine negative financial states (e.g. pot below target)
- Pre-check upsell options or hide cancellation flows
- Add features that reward browsing over task completion (e.g. feeds that reward passive consumption)
- Auto-advance through ceremony steps — let users control pace

## ALWAYS

- Design ceremonies with **greeting → work → celebration** arc (never collapse to a single form)
- Include explicit confirmation before destructive actions
- Make notification copy specific and actionable (e.g. "Payday tomorrow — your ritual takes 15 minutes")
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` in all animations and transitions
- Show **one clear primary action** per screen; secondary actions visually subordinate
- Use progressive disclosure: simple defaults, complexity on request
- Write empty states as calm orientation ("Nothing here yet — [X] will appear after [Y]"), not aspirational pressure
- Include data export and account deletion as prominent user controls
- Write error messages without shame ("That didn't work — try again", not "Invalid input")
- Design for completion: every screen needs a clear "done" exit

## MEASURE

- Ritual completion rate (not DAU)
- Time-to-done (not session length)
- Voluntary return rate (not notification open rate)
