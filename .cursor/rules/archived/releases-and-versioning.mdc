# Releases and Version Numbers

When implementing changes that warrant a release, or when the user asks for a version bump or release:

1. **Use semantic versioning (semver):** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
   - **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, small fixes, no breaking or new features.
   - **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, backward-compatible.
   - **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes.

2. **Choose the bump from the change type:**
   - `fix:` / bug fix → bump PATCH.
   - `feat:` / new feature → bump MINOR.
   - Breaking change or major refactor → bump MAJOR.

3. **Update version in this repo:**
   - Root `package.json` and any workspace `package.json` that are part of the released surface (e.g. `apps/web`, published packages). Keep them in sync when they are released together.
   - Do not bump version for docs-only or tooling-only changes unless the user asks for a release.

4. **Do it automatically when appropriate:** When you implement a feature, fix, or breaking change and commit, propose the version bump and apply it in the same change set (or the next commit) unless the user says otherwise.

5. **Best practice:** Prefer a single source of truth (e.g. root `package.json` for the app version). In a monorepo, internal packages can stay at a shared version or use workspace versions as needed.

**Exclusions:** Exploratory or throwaway changes, or when the user says "no version bump" — then skip version updates.
