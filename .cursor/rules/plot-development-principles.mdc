# PLOT Development Principles

Every feature, every line of code, every UX decision must align with these principles:

## A. SISYPHEAN REALISM
- Don't pretend automation eliminates household work
- Design for ritual and rhythm, not elimination
- Accept that bills, chores, meals are repetitive
- Make repetition bearable, not invisible

**Code implication:**
- Recurring tasks/bills should be explicit, not hidden
- Rituals should have clear entry/exit points
- No "magic" automation that obscures what's happening

---

## B. LABOR EQUITY
- One person should never be the "household manager"
- All household work should be visible and trackable
- Distribute mental load through shared systems

**Code implication:**
- No "admin" or "owner" roles that concentrate power
- Fairness tracking in Tasks module (who does what)
- Both partners see everything by default (no hidden views)
- Audit trails for who added/completed what

---

## D. USER AUTONOMY
- Software assists; users decide
- No AI "optimization" or predictive manipulation
- Users understand what the system is doing

**Code implication:**
- No black-box AI recommendations
- All calculations shown (don't just show result, show formula)
- Users can override any system suggestion
- No "nudges" or dark patterns

---

## E. CONSTRAINT AS KINDNESS
- One or two great ways to do each thing
- Opinionated workflows, not infinite customization
- Simple systems beat complex ones

**Code implication:**
- Resist feature bloat (each feature must solve real pain)
- Default settings should work for 80% of users
- Advanced options hidden behind "Advanced" toggle
- If adding configuration, question whether feature is needed at all

---

## F. TIME RESPECT
- 15 minutes at payday, 10 minutes on Sunday
- Don't optimize for engagement or daily active users
- Tools should disappear when not needed

**Code implication:**
- No gamification (streaks, badges, points)
- No pushy notifications (only essential: "payday tomorrow")
- Fast load times (no loading spinners)
- Offline-capable where possible (mobile)
- Instant feedback (optimistic UI updates)

---

## G. REALITY OVER ASPIRATION
- Don't sell transformation or life optimization
- Acknowledge household work is boring but necessary
- Honest about what software can/can't do

**Code implication:**
- Copy should be straightforward, not motivational
- No "achievement unlocked" language
- Error messages honest, not cutesy
- Onboarding sets realistic expectations

---

## H. BUILT WITH USERS
- Founding members influence roadmap
- Partner feedback integrated from day one
- Products emerge from conversation, not isolation

**Code implication:**
- Feature flags for beta testing with founding members
- In-app feedback mechanism (not just support email)
- Changelogs visible and honest
- Decision rationale documented (why we built X)

---

## Decision Framework

When evaluating a feature request or design decision:

1. Does it align with our principles?
2. Does it solve real pain for real users?
3. Does it respect user time and autonomy?
4. Does it maintain simplicity?
5. Does it preserve privacy?

If no to any → don't build it.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Engagement optimization (notifications, streaks, daily goals)
❌ Dark patterns (hidden costs, confusing cancellation)
❌ Surveillance features (bank connections, transaction scraping)
❌ AI black boxes (unexplained recommendations)
❌ Complexity creep (too many configuration options)
❌ Hierarchy enforcement (admin roles that concentrate power)
❌ Aspiration marketing ("transform your life!")
❌ Feature cloning (copying competitors without purpose)

---

If in doubt: **Would this feature make Adam's household's life better?**
If no → don't build it.
