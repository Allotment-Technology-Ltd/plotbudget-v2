# Releases and Version Numbers

When implementing changes that warrant a release, or when the user asks for a version bump or release:

1. **Use semantic versioning (semver):** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
   - **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, small fixes, no breaking or new features.
   - **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, backward-compatible.
   - **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes.

2. **Choose the bump from the change type:**
   - `fix:` / bug fix → bump PATCH.
   - `feat:` / new feature → bump MINOR.
   - Breaking change or major refactor → bump MAJOR.

3. **Update version numbers with every production release:**
   - **Do update** the version with every production release. When you implement a feature, fix, or breaking change that will be released, apply the bump in the same change set (or the next commit) unless the user says "no version bump".
   - **Where to update:** Root `package.json` and `apps/web/package.json` (the app version shown in Settings → Advanced comes from `apps/web/package.json`). Keep them in sync when released together. Also update any other workspace `package.json` that is part of the released surface (e.g. published packages).
   - **Do not bump** for docs-only, tooling-only, or exploratory changes unless the user asks for a release.

4. **Best practice:** Prefer a single source of truth (e.g. root and `apps/web` at the same version for the app). In a monorepo, internal packages can stay at a shared version or use workspace versions as needed.

**Exclusions:** Exploratory or throwaway changes, or when the user says "no version bump" — then skip version updates.
