# Chat wrap-up

When the user signals that development for this chat is **complete**, treat it as a wrap-up and do the following.

**Keyword / phrases to treat as wrap-up:**  
`wrap up`, `chat complete`, `we're done`, `done for now`, `that's it for this chat`, `close down this chat`, or similar (e.g. "can you wrap up" or "let's close this chat").

**When you see a wrap-up signal:**

1. **Do not start or suggest new work.** Keep the reply short and conclusive.
2. **Offer (or run if the user already asked) these actions:**
   - **Sync main (plotbudget):** From the plotbudget repo root, run `git fetch origin --prune`, then `git checkout main && git pull origin main`, then switch back to the user's branch. Report if any local branches are ahead/behind their remotes.
   - If there are uncommitted changes, ask whether to commit and push them (on the current branch), or note them for the user.
3. **Give a one- or two-sentence summary** of what was done in this chat (e.g. "This chat: added X, fixed Y, pushed branch Z.").
4. **End with a short sign-off** (e.g. "You’re all set. Say 'wrap up' anytime to run this again.").

Keep the whole reply brief (a few short paragraphs at most). Do not open new tasks, suggest follow-ups, or add detail unless the user asks.
