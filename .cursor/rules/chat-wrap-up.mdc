# Chat wrap-up

When the user signals that development for this chat is **complete**, treat it as a wrap-up and do the following.

**Keyword / phrases to treat as wrap-up:**  
`wrap up`, `chat complete`, `we're done`, `done for now`, `that's it for this chat`, `close down this chat`, or similar (e.g. "can you wrap up" or "let's close this chat").

**When you see a wrap-up signal:**

1. **Do not start or suggest new work.** Keep the reply short and conclusive.
2. **Offer (or run if the user already asked) these actions:**
   - **Sync main (plotbudget):** From the plotbudget repo root, run `git fetch origin --prune`, then `git checkout main && git pull origin main`, then switch back to the user's branch. Report if any local branches are ahead/behind their remotes.
   - If there are uncommitted changes, ask whether to commit and push them (on the current branch), or note them for the user.
   - **Linear — close related tickets with wrap-up comments:** Identify related Linear issues from the **current branch name** (e.g. `feature/PLOT-88-89-90-ui-defaults` → PLOT-88, PLOT-89, PLOT-90) and/or from work explicitly done in the chat. For each such issue that was completed in this chat:
     - **Add a comment** to the issue with: PR link (if a PR exists for the branch), brief summary of updates made, and any issues found and resolved (e.g. CI fix, follow-up removals). Use Markdown; keep the comment concise.
     - **Set the issue state to Done** (or the team's completed status) so the ticket is closed.
     If the branch name has no Linear IDs or you're unsure which tickets to close, skip Linear updates and mention in the reply that the user can close tickets manually.
3. **Give a one- or two-sentence summary** of what was done in this chat (e.g. "This chat: added X, fixed Y, pushed branch Z.").
4. **End with a short sign-off** (e.g. "You’re all set. Say 'wrap up' anytime to run this again.").

Keep the whole reply brief (a few short paragraphs at most). Do not open new tasks, suggest follow-ups, or add detail unless the user asks.
