## Part 1: UX Principles

### The Core Problem

PLOT has eight interconnected modules, cross-module linking, ceremonies, projects with phases, real-time sync, and dual-person household management. If the user sees *any* of this complexity, we've failed.

The UX job is to make PLOT feel like **one simple app that does a lot**, not **eight apps duct-taped together**.

### Principle 1: Progressive Disclosure — "Reveal, Don't Overwhelm"

The user should never see more than one level of depth at a time. Complexity exists in the system, but the user only encounters it when they drill down.

**In practice:**
- The home screen shows *what's happening* — not *everything that exists*
- Tapping an activity feed item takes you to the relevant detail — you never need to know which "module" it came from
- Cross-module links are invisible to the user. They don't see "this task was auto-generated by the Meals module." They see "Do the weekly shop — due Saturday"
- Settings for each module are accessed *within* that module, not in a giant global settings page

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** A settings screen with eight module sections each containing ten toggles. Instead, each module has a small gear icon in its own header that reveals only its own configuration.

### Principle 2: The River, Not The Lake — "Flow Over Structure"

Most household apps present information as static pools: here's your calendar, here's your task list, here's your budget. PLOT presents information as a **river** — a flow of what's happening, what needs attention, and what's coming up.

**In practice:**
- The home screen is an activity feed + smart cards, not a dashboard of widgets
- The feed mixes items from all modules naturally: "Partner marked Rent as paid" sits next to "Grocery list updated" sits next to "Boiler service due next week"
- Smart cards surface *actions needed* without the user having to go looking: "You have 3 unpaid bills this cycle," "Weekly Reset is ready," "Barcelona trip: flight deposit due Friday"
- The user's primary interaction pattern is: open app → scan feed → tap the thing that needs attention → handle it → back to feed

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** A dashboard with eight widget boxes showing summary stats for each module. This forces the user to visually parse eight things and decide which one matters. The feed decides for them.

### Principle 3: Ceremonies Are Stories — "Guide, Don't Present"

PLOT's ceremonies (Payday Ritual, Weekly Reset, Quarterly Health Check, Trip Planning) are its most differentiated feature. They must feel like **guided experiences with narrative arc**, not forms to fill in.

**In practice:**
- Each ceremony has a beginning (greeting/context), middle (the work), and end (celebration/summary)
- Progress is visible throughout: "Step 2 of 4" or a progress bar
- The tone shifts during ceremonies: slightly more conversational, encouraging, with personality
- Completion triggers a satisfying moment: confetti, a summary card, a "you're done" animation
- Ceremonies are **interruptible and resumable**. Life happens. The user can leave mid-ceremony and pick up exactly where they left off

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** A ceremony that's just a sequence of form screens with "Next" buttons. Each step should feel purposeful and reward completion.

### Principle 4: Two People, One App — "Togetherness Without Collision"

PLOT is fundamentally a two-person app. Every screen must subtly acknowledge that another person is part of this household without making the interface feel crowded.

**In practice:**
- Activity feed naturally shows what your partner has been doing — this is the "heartbeat" of shared living
- Task assignment uses avatar chips (small circular photos/initials), not dropdown selects
- "Me" and "Partner" are represented by consistent colours throughout (not module colours — *person* colours). User = accent colour, Partner = a warm secondary colour
- When both people are editing the grocery list simultaneously, you see real-time cursors/checkmarks — a "we're in this together" feeling
- Joint items always show the split: "Rent — £1,200 (£720 you / £480 partner)"

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Separate "my view" and "partner's view" tabs. Everything is *our* view with clear attribution of who owns what.

### Principle 5: Module Boundaries Are Invisible — "One App, Not Eight"

The user should rarely think about which "module" they're in. Navigation exists, but the app should feel like a continuous experience, not a collection of mini-apps.

**In practice:**
- The bottom tab bar shows 4 primary destinations (Home, Money, Tasks, Calendar) + a "More" menu for less-frequent modules
- Cross-module items appear where they're contextually relevant, not where they're technically stored. A trip's payment deadline shows in the Money module's upcoming bills *and* on the Calendar *and* in the trip detail. The user doesn't need to know it "lives" in the Holidays module.
- Global search returns results across all modules, grouped naturally: "boiler" finds the maintenance item, the British Gas vault entry, the annual service bill, and last year's receipt
- Deep links from notifications go directly to the relevant item, regardless of module

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** A hamburger menu with eight module names listed vertically. This makes the app feel like a filing cabinet. Instead, navigation should feel spatial and contextual.

### Principle 6: Speed Is Trust — "Instant Feels Reliable"

For a finance and household management app, perceived speed directly correlates with trust. If the app hesitates, users hesitate to rely on it.

**In practice:**
- Optimistic updates everywhere: checking off a task or grocery item responds instantly, syncs in background
- Skeleton screens (not spinners) for loading states — the UI shape appears immediately, content fills in
- Swipe gestures for common actions: swipe right to complete a task, swipe left to snooze/skip
- Pull-to-refresh on all list views
- Haptic feedback on completions (mobile): a subtle "tick" when you check something off

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Loading spinners, especially full-screen ones. If the user sees a spinner when checking off a grocery item, the app feels broken.

### Principle 7: Calm Technology — "Inform, Don't Alarm"

PLOT handles sensitive topics: money, fairness, responsibility. The UX must be calm, never anxiety-inducing.

**In practice:**
- Budget overallocation is shown as amber information, not red alarm. "You've allocated £50 more than your income this cycle" — factual, not judgemental
- Fairness scores are presented as neutral data, never as accusations. "Task split this month: 62% / 38%" — not "Partner isn't pulling their weight"
- Notifications are batched and prioritised. No notification avalanche. Morning summary: "3 things need your attention today"
- Empty states are encouraging, not sad. An empty meal plan says "What are we eating this week?" not "No meals planned"

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Red warning badges on every module icon. Notification counts on everything. Aggressive "you haven't done X" prompts.

## Part 2: Information Architecture

### Navigation Model (Mobile)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 APP SHELL                    │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │          CONTENT AREA               │    │
│  │  (Screens render here)              │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘    │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │          BOTTOM TAB BAR             │    │
│  │  Home  Money  Tasks  Cal   More     │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Bottom Tab Bar — 5 Slots

| Position | Label | Module | Rationale |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Home | Activity Feed + Smart Cards | Always the starting point |
| 2 | Money | Budget, Seeds, Ritual | Core module, most frequent |
| 3 | Tasks | Tasks, Routines, Projects | Second most frequent |
| 4 | Calendar | Events, Schedule | Daily reference |
| 5 | More | Meals, Holidays, Vault, Home, Kids, Settings | Overflow |

**Web sidebar:** On desktop, the bottom bar becomes a left sidebar with all modules visible as icon + label pairs. Collapses to icons-only on smaller screens.

## Part 3: Key Screen Specifications

### 3.1 Home Screen (Activity Feed)

The most important screen. Answers: **"What's happening in our household?"**

**Layout (top to bottom):**

1. **Header bar** — PLOT logo (left), profile avatar (right). Clean, minimal.
2. **Smart card carousel** — Horizontal scroll, only visible when actions are needed. If nothing needs attention, this section is absent (a positive signal).
3. **Activity feed** — Grouped by day ("Today", "Yesterday", etc.). Mixed items from all modules. Infinite scroll.

**Smart card triggers:**

| Card | Trigger | Tap destination |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Unpaid Bills | Unpaid seeds in active cycle | Payday Ritual |
| Weekly Reset | Reset day, not yet completed | Weekly Reset ceremony |
| Payment Due | Any item due within 7 days | The specific item |
| Expiry Warning | Vault item expires within 30 days | Vault item |
| Overallocated | Allocations exceed income | Blueprint |
| Ceremony Ready | Any ceremony ready | That ceremony |

**Smart card design:** Coloured left border (4px, module colour), bold title, one-line description, right chevron. Max 3 visible, horizontally scrollable.

**Feed item anatomy:**
- Avatar (32px circle) — user photo, partner photo, or system icon
- Actor + action verb + object (tappable, navigates to detail)
- Timestamp (relative) + module label (only for system items)

**Empty state:** Seed illustration + "Your household feed will come alive as you start using PLOT" + CTAs for first actions.

### 3.2 Money Module

**Overview screen (top to bottom):**
1. Cycle name + date range
2. Large income number (JetBrains Mono, 32px)
3. Single allocation progress bar with percentage
4. Category pills (Needs/Wants/Savings/Repay) — colour-coded, tappable, showing amount per category
5. Quick action buttons: "Add Seed" + "Start Ritual"
6. Recent seeds list (unpaid first, sorted by amount)

### 3.3 Tasks Module

**My Tasks (default view):**
- Grouped: Overdue (red accent) → Today → This Week → Later
- Swipe right to complete, swipe left for secondary actions
- Each task shows: checkbox, name, source indicator (routine/project/standalone), assignee avatar chip, due date if set
- Toggle between list view and kanban board via segmented control in header

**Kanban board (mobile):**
- Full-width columns, swipe horizontally between them (like Trello mobile)
- Column header: name + count
- Cards: task name, assignee avatar, due date, priority dot
- Long-press + drag to move between columns

**Project detail:**
- Cover image with project title overlay
- Progress indicator (phase X of Y, percentage)
- Budget section: linked pot progress + linked repayment balance
- Phase list as vertical timeline: completed (collapsed) → active (expanded with tasks) → future (collapsed)

### 3.4 Ceremony Flow Pattern

All ceremonies share this skeleton:

**Step 1 — Greeting:** Conversational welcome, context setting, optional editable fields (e.g., confirm income). Single "Let's go" CTA.

**Steps 2-N — The Work:** Category-by-category or item-by-item review. Checkboxes, toggles, assignments. Clear progress indication. "Next" CTA at bottom.

**Final Step — Completion:** Celebration moment (subtle animation), summary stats, "Back to Home" CTA.

**Ceremony UX rules:**
1. Full-screen takeover — no tab bar visible
2. Swipeable between steps
3. Interruptible — X button exits, progress saved, resumable later
4. No dead ends — every step has a clear forward action
5. Haptic punctuation — light on task completion, strong on ceremony completion

### 3.5 Bottom Sheet Pattern

Bottom sheets are the primary input mechanism for adding/editing items.

**Three heights:** Peek (25%), Half (50%), Full (90%). Drag to resize. Dismiss by dragging down or tapping dimmed background.

**Rules:**
- Keyboard-aware: sheet pushes up when input focused
- No nested sheets — use inline selectors for sub-selections
- Confirm destructive actions inline (two buttons), not alert dialogs

### 3.6 "More" Menu

Bottom sheet (half height) with a 3-column grid of module icons. Pro-only modules show a "PRO" badge. Global search entry point at the bottom.

## Part 4: Interaction Patterns

### Gesture Vocabulary (Consistent Across App)

| Gesture | Action | Where |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Swipe right | Complete / Mark done | Tasks, Seeds, Grocery items |
| Swipe left | Secondary action (delete/reschedule/skip) | Tasks, Seeds, Feed items |
| Long press | Multi-select / Drag reorder | Kanban cards, lists |
| Pull down | Refresh | All list views |
| Tap | Navigate / Toggle | Everything |
| Double tap | Quick inline edit | Seeds, Tasks |

### Feedback Patterns

| Event | Visual | Haptic |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Item completed | Strikethrough + green flash + slide out | Light tap |
| Ceremony step done | Progress dot fills, slide transition | Medium tap |
| Ceremony finished | Celebration animation | Strong tap |
| Error | Red shake on field | Error buzz |
| Sync in progress | Subtle rotating icon | None |
| Sync conflict | Amber toast message | Light tap |

### Loading States

**Never use spinners.** Use skeleton screens with shimmer effect for initial loads. Inline indicators for background sync. Pull-to-refresh is the only acceptable spinner (user-initiated).

### Empty States

Every list needs a designed empty state. These are conversion opportunities, not error messages.

| Screen | Message | CTA |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Feed | "Your household feed will come alive as you start using PLOT." | Start Payday Ritual |
| Seeds | "No bills or expenses yet." | Add Seed |
| Tasks | "Nothing on the list. Enjoy the peace." | Add Task / Set Up Routines |
| Projects | "Planning a renovation? A big purchase?" | Create Project |
| Meal Plan | "What are we eating this week?" | Plan Meals |
| Grocery List | "The list is clear. Well done." | Add Item |
| Trips | "Where to next?" | Plan a Trip |
| Vault | "Your important documents, all in one place." | Add First Item |

### Notification Strategy

| Tier | Channel | Examples |
|------|---------|---------|
| Urgent | Push + in-app | Payment due today, item expired |
| Action needed | Push (batched) + in-app | Ceremony ready, partner invite |
| Informational | In-app feed only | Partner activity, updates |
| Digest | Email (weekly) | Weekly summary |

**Max 3 push notifications per day.** Morning batch at 8am: "Today: 2 bills to pay, grocery shop, school run." Partner activity is feed-only, never push.

## Part 5: Visual Design Specifications

### Module Colour System

Each module has a subtle colour identity for feed items, smart cards, and headers. These are accents, never dominant fills.

| Module | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Money | Forest Green `#0E8345` | Mint `#69F0AE` |
| Tasks | Blue `#2563EB` | Light Blue `#60A5FA` |
| Calendar | Purple `#7C3AED` | Light Purple `#A78BFA` |
| Meals | Orange `#EA580C` | Light Orange `#FB923C` |
| Holidays | Teal `#0D9488` | Light Teal `#5EEAD4` |
| Vault | Slate `#475569` | Light Slate `#94A3B8` |
| Home | Amber `#D97706` | Light Amber `#FCD34D` |
| Kids | Pink `#DB2777` | Light Pink `#F472B6` |

**Usage:** Left border on cards (4px), small dots/badges, section header accents. Never full background fills. PLOT brand colours remain dominant.

### Person Colour System

| Person | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Me | Accent Green at 15% opacity | Mint at 15% opacity |
| Partner | Terracotta `#C78D75` at 15% opacity | Muted Terracotta `#9D6B47` at 15% opacity |
| Joint | Both avatars stacked or split indicator | Same |

### Typography in App

| Element | Font | Weight | Mobile Size |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| Screen titles | Space Mono | 700 | 20px |
| Section headers | Space Mono | 700 | 14px uppercase |
| Card titles | Inter | 600 | 16px |
| Body text | Inter | 400 | 15px |
| Secondary text | Inter | 400 | 13px |
| Labels / metadata | Space Mono | 400 | 12px |
| Large numbers | JetBrains Mono | 500 | 32px |
| Button text | Space Mono | 700 | 14px uppercase |

Body text is always Inter. Monospace reserved for headings, labels, numbers, and buttons.

### Spacing

Base unit: 4px. Everything is a multiple of 4. Mobile screen padding: 16px horizontal.

### Component Specs

**Card:** bg-card, 1px border at 8%, 12px radius, 16px padding, no shadow in dark mode.

**Smart Card:** bg-card, 4px left border (module colour), 12px radius, 16px padding, 72px min height.
