  description: "Enforce Next.js image optimization; disallow raw <img> elements and unoptimized flag."
  content: |
    Always use `<Image>` from `next/image` instead of raw `<img>` elements in apps/web.
    Never set `images.unoptimized: true` in next.config.js.
    For LCP/hero images, add `priority` prop and explicit `width`/`height` or a sized container to prevent CLS.
    When `<img>` is genuinely needed (e.g. user-generated content with dynamic src), add an ESLint disable comment with a brief justification.
    CI runs `scripts/find-plain-img.js` and will fail if unapproved `<img>` tags are found.

  description: "Default to React Server Components; only use 'use client' when interactivity requires it."
  content: |
    Default to React Server Components (RSC). Only add `'use client'` when the component uses browser APIs, hooks, or event handlers.
    Never import `server-only` modules (DB clients, secrets) into Client Components.
    Keep `'use client'` boundaries as small as possible — put interactive slices in small leaf components rather than entire pages.
    Never place blocking auth/profile fetches (createServerSupabaseClient, supabase.auth.getUser) in global public marketing layouts; these must be in dashboard/authenticated route layouts only.

  description: "Enforce strict TypeScript: no any, no ts-ignore, Zod validation for all external input."
  content: |
    Never use `any` type. Use `unknown` and narrow, or define proper types.
    Never use `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` without an explanatory comment and a linked issue.
    Validate all user input, API payloads, and webhook bodies with Zod on the server before use.
    Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
    Zero-trust: treat all client input as untrusted; validate and sanitize server-side.

  description: "Keep the client-side JS bundle under 300 KB; avoid heavyweight dependencies."
  content: |
    Before adding a new npm dependency to apps/web, estimate its gzipped size (https://bundlephobia.com).
    Prefer lighter alternatives; import only the submodules you need.
    If a dependency adds > 250 KB gzipped, document the justification in the PR.
    Use dynamic `import()` for large optional features (dialogs, chart libraries, rich editors).
    Pin or use conservative semver ranges for production dependencies in apps/web/package.json.

  content: |
    PostHog, Vercel Speed Insights, and other analytics must be initialised inside a `useEffect` or deferred via dynamic import with `ssr: false`.
    Never call `posthog.init()` or `injectSpeedInsights()` synchronously in server layouts or top-level client entrypoints for public/marketing pages.
    Always respect user consent before sending analytics events.

  context: "apps/web/**/*.{ts,tsx} — all UI components and pages"
  description: "Achieve WCAG 2.2 AAA: 44px touch targets, sufficient colour contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels."
  content: |
    All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) must have a minimum touch target of 44×44 px (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.5 AAA). Use `min-h-11 min-w-11` (Tailwind h-11 = 2.75rem = 44px at 16px base) on interactive elements.
    Colour contrast must meet WCAG AAA ratios (7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text).
    All interactive elements must be keyboard-accessible with visible focus indicators (`focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`).
    Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<button>`, etc.) rather than `<div>` with click handlers.
    Provide `aria-label` on icon-only buttons; use `aria-current="page"` on active navigation links.
    Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for all animations and transitions.

  description: "Apply PLOT Calm Design: design for completion not engagement; no dark patterns."
  content: |
    Design for task completion and intention, not engagement maximisation.
    Every screen must have a clear primary action and a clear exit/done state.
    Use progressive disclosure: simple defaults with complexity accessible on request.
    No infinite scroll, streaks, countdown timers, or false urgency.
    Notification copy must be specific and actionable.
    Destructive actions require explicit confirmation dialogs.
    Empty states guide orientation without pressure: "Nothing here yet — X appears after Y."
    Ceremonies follow greeting → work → celebration arc; never collapse to a bare form.

- name: mobile-responsive-layout
  context: "apps/web/**/*.{ts,tsx} — all dashboard and module pages"
  description: "All layouts must be fully usable on screens ≥ 375 px wide; no content clipping or overflow."
  content: |
    Test all new UI at 375 px viewport width (iPhone SE baseline).
    Scrollable tab lists must use `flex` (not `inline-flex`) as the container so `overflow-x-auto` creates a proper scroll region.
    Header rows that contain a heading + multiple action buttons must use `flex flex-wrap gap-3` so they reflow rather than clip on narrow screens.
    Bottom navigation docks with > 4 modules must not show all items on mobile; surface a "More" affordance to avoid cramping.
    Use `sm:` breakpoint prefix consistently to opt into wider layouts at 640 px and above.
