## Value Proposition

**Primary (recommended by guide):**  
"The 20-minute payday ritual that replaces every awkward money conversation."

**Supporting:**  
PLOT is a relationship tool that happens to use budget mechanics — not a budgeting app. Money is the #1 cause of relationship stress; the stress is about the conversation. PLOT replaces ad-hoc uncomfortable conversations with a structured ritual.

## Audience Segments

### Primary: UK couples (core USP)

- Cohabiting couples (married or unmarried)
- Dual-income households
- Aged 25–40, budget-aware
- Manual-entry willing (privacy-first, no bank linking)

### Secondary: Solo users (acquisition funnel)

- Individuals managing household finances on their own
- People who may (or may not) invite a partner later
- "Solo or shared" flexibility: works for one person or two

**Messaging for solo:** Don't exclude. Welcome them. "PLOT works for solo use or with a partner. Invite someone anytime — or not. It's your choice." Never assume solo users want a partner or are waiting for one. Keep couples as the USP while making solo users feel fully included.

---

## Inclusivity

- **Solo users are fully welcome.** Never assume they want a partner or are "waiting for one."
- Use "household" over "couples" where it fits — inclusive of one or more people.
- Inviting a partner is optional: "Invite someone anytime — or not. It's your choice."
- Problem/solution copy can reference couples (it's the core use case) but the overall framing must never make solo users feel awkward or excluded.

## Tone of Voice

- **Relationship-focused**, not purely transactional
- **Warm**, practical, non-judgmental
- **Benefit-led** over feature-led
- Use "you/your"; avoid passive voice; keep sentences short
- Frame: "payday ritual," "replaces awkward money conversations," "relationship tool"
