**Option A – Short and direct**

We’ve been building PLOT to make budgeting with your pay cycle and life goals (savings pots, repayments) actually stick. The web app is live and we’d love more people to try it so we can see how it performs in the wild and fix the rough edges.

If you’re up for trying a different way to plan your money—and don’t mind the occasional bump—give it a go and tell us what’s working and what’s not. There’s a **Feedback & bugs** link in the app so you can report issues or ideas in one click.

Link: [plotbudget.com](https://plotbudget.com) (or your app URL)

**Option B – Slightly longer, more story**

Budgeting tools often assume monthly pay and generic categories. We built PLOT around *your* pay date, your bills, and goals like holidays or clearing debt—so your plan matches how you actually get paid and spend.

The web app is in the wild and we want to make it faster and more reliable. To do that we need more people using it and telling us where it breaks or feels wrong.

If you’re open to trying something that’s still evolving, we’d really value your time. Use the app, and if something’s slow, confusing, or broken, hit **Feedback & bugs** in the menu—we read every submission and use it to prioritise fixes.

Try it: [plotbudget.com](https://plotbudget.com)

**Option C – One-liner + CTA**

We’re looking for people to stress-test the PLOT web app and tell us what’s broken or confusing. Try it at [plotbudget.com](https://plotbudget.com) and send feedback via the **Feedback & bugs** link in the app—we use it to prioritise performance and fixes.

**Tips**
- Add your app URL (e.g. app.plotbudget.com) if it’s different from the marketing site.
- If you have a waitlist or signup page, link that instead of the homepage.
- Consider a follow-up post in a few weeks: “We fixed X and Y thanks to your feedback.”
