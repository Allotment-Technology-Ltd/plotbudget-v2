# Changelog UX guide

The **user-facing changelog** is what people read on the marketing site (“What’s new”). This guide makes sure it’s written with good UX from the start so it’s clear, useful, and needs little or no sanitization at release.

## Why this matters

- **User goal:** Readers want to know what changed and how it affects them — not an audit log of commits.
- **Clarity:** Plain language and a consistent structure reduce cognitive load and build trust.
- **Information architecture:** Grouping by version and theme helps people scan and find what they care about.

## Source of truth

| File | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **`apps/marketing/content/changelog.md`** | User-facing “What’s new” on the marketing site. **Write this with the rules below.** Prebuild copies it to `public/changelog.md` for the site. |
| **`CHANGELOG.md`** (repo root) | Generated by semantic-release from commits. Kept for dev/release history; not the primary source for the public page. |

When you release, **update the curated changelog** in `apps/marketing/content/changelog.md` using this guide. That way the site shows user-friendly copy with minimal or no sanitization.

## UX principles for changelog entries

### 1. Write for the person using PLOT

- **Do:** Describe the change and its benefit. *“Pick GBP, USD, or EUR in Household Settings; all amounts update across the app.”*
- **Avoid:** Technical or internal wording. *“Add updateHouseholdCurrency server action with Zod validation.”*

### 2. Use plain language

- **Do:** “Add PLOT to your home screen”, “Partner name now shows correctly”, “Clearer calls to action”.
- **Avoid:** Jargon, ticket refs, and commit-style phrasing: “PLOT-86”, “feat(ux):”, “fix(e2e):”, “migration”, “server action”, “Zod”.

### 3. No parentheses for refs

- **Do:** “Security and dependency updates so your data stays safe.”
- **Avoid:** “Security updates (#52, #53).” or “(2026-02-15)”.

### 4. Structure for scanning

- Use a **short version title** that summarises the theme: *“1.4 — Native app feel”*, *“1.1.1 — Security and reliability”*.
- Group bullets by **theme** (e.g. Settings, Subscriptions, Mobile app). One line per idea; optional bold lead-in: *“**Currency:** Pick GBP, USD, or EUR…”*.
- Keep **one idea per bullet** so the list is easy to scan.

### 5. Be consistent

- Same format for every version: version number + short title, then bullets.
- Use the same tone: helpful and neutral, not marketing hype or dev-speak.
- Prefer “you” and “your” where it fits: “your home screen”, “your data”.

### 6. Omit internal-only changes

- **Do include:** User-visible features, fixes, and improvements (settings, UI, security, performance, emails they receive).
- **Do not include:** CI, E2E, migrations, dependency bumps, refactors, or tooling unless they directly affect what the user sees or experiences.

## Structure of `apps/marketing/content/changelog.md`

Keep this shape so the page stays predictable and easy to maintain:

```markdown
# What's new

One-line intro. (e.g. “Recent updates to PLOT. We ship regularly…”)

---

## Month Year

### X.Y — Short theme title

- **Topic:** One sentence describing what changed and why it matters to the user.
- Repeat for each user-facing change.

### X.Y.Z — Another theme

- Same pattern.

---

## Earlier updates

- Short bullets for older, high-level themes (no need to list every past version).
```

---

## Good vs avoid (examples)

| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|--------|
| **Settings:** Partner name now shows correctly in the profile tab. | profile-tab partner name, E2E logout/visual, Linear branch rule |
| **Currency:** Pick GBP, USD, or EUR in Household Settings; all amounts and symbols update across the app. | Add currency selection to Household Settings tab with GBP/USD/EUR options; add updateHouseholdCurrency server action with Zod validation. |
| **Security:** Dependency updates and internal security improvements so your data stays safe. | **security:** autofix 3rd party Github Actions should be pinned (#53) |
| **Mobile app:** Smoother, more native experience with updated bottom sheets and small interaction tweaks. | **native:** Phase 2b Native Feel — bottom sheets, micro-interaction… (#65) |

## When to update

1. **When cutting a release:** After semantic-release updates `CHANGELOG.md` and version numbers, add a matching entry to `apps/marketing/content/changelog.md` using the rules above.
2. **Content:** Base the entry on what actually shipped (from commits/PRs), but **rewrite** into user-facing language; do not paste raw commit lines.
3. **Prebuild:** The marketing app’s prebuild copies `content/changelog.md` to `public/changelog.md`, so the next deploy will show the new copy. No extra sanitization step is required if you write per this guide.

## Checklist before you add a version

- [ ] Version number and short theme title (e.g. `### 1.5 — Clearer billing`).
- [ ] Each bullet is one idea, in plain language.
- [ ] No ticket refs, commit hashes, or parentheses for refs.
- [ ] No internal-only items (CI, E2E, migrations, tooling) unless they affect the user.
- [ ] Bold lead-in optional but consistent within the entry (e.g. **Topic:** …).

Following this guide keeps the changelog readable and trustworthy and reduces the need for sanitization at release.
