# Worktree CI: Parallel isolated testing using Git worktrees
# Runs on every Pull Request to main
# Demonstrates how to leverage worktrees for parallel test job isolation
#
# This workflow showcases:
# - Creating temporary worktrees for branch testing
# - Running jobs in isolation without checkout conflicts
# - Parallel execution of tests across different apps
